        <h1>Oh, apparently GitHub gives me a website, yay?</h1>
    </header>
        
        <h2>I'm just gonna use this as some sort of dump.</h2>
        
        <p>I have no idea why you are even here. Perhaps I gave you the link? Perhaps you found the link somehow? Perhaps some deity thought I was freaking awesome and blessed you with this link? None of that really matters, because there isn't really anything to enjoy here. That is, unless you enjoy looking through my old projects and homework.</p>

        <p>Anyways, now that you are here, I might as well tell you a few things about me, because that's what you do with these sorts of websites, right? Right. I was born somewhen between big bang and now. I live in the Milkyway Galaxy, and I bang my head to people screaming inconherintly. Also, I like smashing my keyboard into code, which takes most of my time. Aside from this, I take interest in a whole lot of different shit. Seriously, if you have ever talked to me while I was drunk, you'd know excactly what I mean. I can talk practically forever about anything.</p>

        <p>However, when I'm not breaking my neck, smashing my keyboard, being born, or being drunk, I like videogames. Yes, I am that fucking special. At the time of writing, I find PlanetSide 2 to be one helluva drug. Also, school is fun, because I learn HTML, robotics, computer architecture, binary, process control, and a lot of other shit. One day I might even know enough HTML to write a proper website, instead of just stealing it off some other fellow, and rewriting major parts of it.</p>

        <p>I would call myself an experienced programmer, but that would be a lie. I can one language enough to write games out of it, which is C#. I also know a bunch of GML, but that's not really a language that counts. Also, I can write an amount of Javascript, but that's practically only because I know C#, and they aren't awfully different, at least at the basic level. While I can't really call it work, I am working in a group-thingie-studio called Awesomenium Studios, which I formed with a friend of mine, and create games with many other friends to put up there. Though, we don't have anything to put up there. Fucking PlanetSide 2, man.</p>

        <p>No, I am not an educated programmer. I'm not really an educated anything, because I just started becoming an educated programmer/computer person. I also sorta techically have a tiny, tiny education education in welding, and therefor have permission, I think. However, I don't care an awful lot about welding, because I have other shit to do.</p>

        <p>I could get really depressive and talk about my personal problems, but that would just be annoying and boring to read. Yes I have problems, and no, I am not going to share them with you, unless I trust you 100%, or is incredibly drunk.</p>

        <p>Anyways, I have written a bunch of different shit during the last couple of years.</p>

        <p><a href="http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/184810-tankmania">TankMania, I made this when I was like 13.</a><br>
        <a href="http://sandbox.yoyogames.com/games/186132-learn-to-drive-those-zombies-down">Learn To Drive Those Zombies Down, this was made when I was about 14, also, it's shit.</a><br>
        <a href="Games/lomztein.github.io/Incoming!.exe">Incoming! My first ever venture into code, instead of drag and drop shit. Approximately two years old.</a><br>
        <a href="Games/lomztein.github.io/Combtress.exe">Combtress, riddled with bugs, as development stopped like 1.5 years ego.</a><br>
        <a href="Games/Fatique.zip">Fatique, my first ever Unity project. You can imagine how well that went.</a><br>
        <a href="Games/AwesomeTD.zip">AwesomeTD, tried to build a 3D tower defence, failed to build a 3D tower defence.</a><br>
        <a href="Games/CombtressArena.zip">Combtress: Arena, was originally planned to have multiplayer, bu failed at that.</a><br>
        <a href="Games/3DBattleshipPrototype.zip">3D Battleship Prototype, wanted to do something voxel-based, and this happened.</a><br>
        <a href="Games/TankManiaReloaded.zip">TankMania: Reloaded, most likely the most refined Unity game I have so far. Also, this actually have a somewhat working multiplayer mode.</a></p>

        <p>None of these projects were ever finished, and will contain bugs, might crash, will lack features, and may very likely suck hard. Seriously, Fatique is barely playable, and I'm pretty sure 3D Battleship Prototype isn't playable either. However, I do believe you can watch a bunch of retarded AI's fighing eachother. IN 3D! :O</p>
                
        <p>I also have a few other places where I put stuff I build. This includes <a href="http://youtube.com/user/Lomztein">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://github.com/lomztein">GitHub</a>, and perhaps some other place which I can't remember.</p>

        <p>Also, I have a <a href="http://twitter.com/lomztein">Twitter</a>, and even a fucking <a href="http://reddit.com/r/Lomztein">Subreddit</a>. I didn't make that Subreddit, but it is the greatest fucking Subreddit ever.

        <p>I also do homework, albiet very rarely:</p>
        <a href="dectobin.html">Some shit I wrote in that converts a number into binary. Also, it's in danish because homework.</a><br>
        <a href="bintodec.html">This one is like the one above, just turns binary into decimal instead. So, the oppisite of the one above.</a></p>

        <p><a href="victor.html">I am putting this here for everyone to forever admire. Created by Victor "MultiScootaloo" Koch.</a><br>It is amazing. If you disagree, you must be terminated through painful means.</p>

        <p>Also, I often take the name "Space Jesus" instead of my regular name. I believe I first got the name from Deep Space 69. <a href= "http://www.youtube.com/show/deepspace69">Go watch Deep Space 69 now.</a> This is due to my very Jesus'y apperance, with long, fabouless hair. Also, I know a thing or two about space, but no more then a thing or two. Whenever people call my by this name, I become God. That last part isn't true, but you'd damn well believe it anyways.</p>

        <p>Holy shit this place makes me sound cynical. I should really stop watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jC67AVcbms&list=PLAbMhAYRuCUhC85vZRvBBdYPJk-9pLN-8&index=175">Zero Punctuation</a>, but you shouldn't. Seriously though, it's mostly just for the lulz, I'm pretty light-heartet. At least that's what I force myself to believe.</p>

        <p>I love my fathers dog "Snehvide" above everything. Now fuck off.</p>
